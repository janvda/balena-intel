                Fixes #1775

                Removed the two patches we included in favor of corresponding
                configure arguments since they had to be updated anyway.

                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a
                state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs,
                the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have
                to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up
                directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make
                it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with
                the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.

                Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running
                resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.


                If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the
                subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

      body: |
        After first boot, the OS will generate the UUID of every partition and
        store their values in a boot partition file. Source this file and pass
        these UUIDs, when available, as part of cmdline so that the OS can use
        them for partition mounts.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

                Our root filesystem is overlayfs or aufs. When latter, the

                crashes when reading a lower directory file. We avoid this by
                always

                falling back to copy and mount (as if overlayfs is not
                available).

                Customer reported Huawei E3372 not working
                anymore starting with balenaOS v2.32.
                The fix for this appears to be switching the modem with
                vid and pid 12d1:1f01 from the cdc_ether legacy mode to
                the faster mbim mode and setting mtu=1460 in the modem
                connection file.

                Fix rollback altboots to prevent good reboots by supervisor
                triggering rollback.

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or
                user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                We'd like to enable some config options for all devices via

                The support is mainline since warrior. Lets copy it in
                meta-balena

                to get it in the previous layers as well.


                We need CMD_SETEXPR to be enabled for rollbacks to work. So
                enable it

                via the config fragment

                Devices using u-boot. Enable rollback-altboot by handling

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                meta-balena. This patch adds a task to include config_resin.h
                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as

                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                systemd

                The data partition contains the supervisor which is only about
                61M on

                the pi3. We compress the data partition later on so don't notice
                these

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

      body: >
        Netflix has identified several TCP networking vulnerabilities

        in FreeBSD and Linux kernels. The vulnerabilities specifically

        relate to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and TCP

        Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) capabilities.

        The most serious, dubbed SACK Panic, allows a

        remotely-triggered kernel panic on recent Linux kernels.


        These patches address most of these vulnerabilities.

                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                Thud breaks when building against kernel version < 4.10. This is
                a known

                issue which is fixed in poky warrior[1]. This patch includes a

                workaround for thud.

                Poky, following os-release(5), sanitizes VERSION_ID accordingly
                but in

                doing so it produces a nonisemver compliant version. For
                example:

                    VERSION="2.37.0+rev1"
                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

              body: >
                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of
                the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is
                enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use
                glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS
                modules

                (libmdns).

                This adds an easier to debug logging that shows both removed and
                kept

                firmwares. For example:

                 Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was
                comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and
                fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly
                retrigger on

                change.

                Also, as

                part of os_cmdline, there is an argument added when the booted
                image is

                a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher
                specific

                The inactive partition is only needed for HUP or rollbacks. This
                commit

                changes the mnt-sysroot-inactive.service unit to an automount so
                that

                the partition is only mounted when used. This improves boot
                time.

                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by
                'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the
                uuid

                generation script fail.


                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does
                that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old
                provider

                (openssl package).

              hash: b7a6412e6368d3d562ff1ca2fb06be92a24a8548
              body: >
                When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what
                symlinks

                to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't
                use

                absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses
                /usr/lib/udev as the

                default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.


                ```
                  Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
                  absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
                  /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
                ```


                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the
                script

                itself.

              hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9

                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based,
                already

                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this
                version throws

                a build warning similar to:


                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for
                /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

                in
                /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


                This happens because again, we import `poky` and
                `security_flags` but

                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to
                avoid

                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc
                file at the

                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a
                small

                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from
                `require`

                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this
                hack in

                the future.


                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                The reason for including this version is that balena-engine
                requires

                newer go compiler and also we want to unify it across our
                supported

                yocto versions to avoid eventual possible runtime issues.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for
                others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs
                can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader
                config

                etc.

                Fix bug where fsck was run on the data partition on every boot
                even if it wasn't needed due to old system time.

                e2fsck by default checks differences between the system time and
                the

                last filesystem mount timestamp.


                As we run on devices without an rtc, and we run the
                filesystem-expand

                service which runs fsck before ntp sync happens, this results in
                errors

                like


                Superblock last mount time (Thu Mar 14 17:13:02 2019,
                      now = Mon Mar 11 15:29:56 2019) is in the future.
                Fix? yes


                This results in fsck running on the data partition on every boot
                which

                slows down the boot time.


                Add e2fsck.conf file with the broken_system_clock flag to
                prevent this

                check from running fsck on every boot. Quite a few distros do
                this as

                well.

                Currently mmc and usb devices are checked at every boot for the
                presence

                of flasher images. USB initialization is slow 1-3 seconds. This
                slows

                boot time significantly.


                Most device types dont need to check for the presence of flasher
                images

                in usb devies. Modify u-boot to only check for mmc devices.


                usb initialization happens in devices via the "usb start"
                command. This

                is usually configured in CONFIG_PREBOOT for devices. Devices
                will need

                to remove "usb start" from CONFIG_PREBOOT to benefit from any
                boot time

                optimization.


                We will need to run "usb start" ourselves via env_resin for any
                device

                that happens to be searching for flasher images in usb device
                types.

                supervisor container;

                in the config IF the container already exists.

                It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary
                because

                it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of
                the build

                system. For example, if there is a leftover kernel_source.tar.gz
                in B,

                then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this
                file in

                the kernel source tree and then the command:

                tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .


                will fail like:

                tar: ./kernel/kernel_source.tar.gz: file changed as we read it

                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

                This implements a default logic for `dnsServers` attribute in

                `config.json` as it follows:


                * when dnsServers is not defined, or empty, the default value of
                it will

                be considered google DNS (8.8.8.8)

                * when dnsServers is "null", the system will not alter
                dnsServers to the

                default server as stated above

                * when dnsServers is defined and not "null" it will be
                considered as

                such without any additional servers servers

              hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.

        It's been observed on EFI machines that at the first boot after
        provisioning there is some bootstrap code in the first sector of
        the boot media (even though during provisioning we make sure we
        remove this bootstrap code). In such a case (only on some machines),
        the next time we reboot the machine, it will not recognize the media
        as a valid EFI boot media and the boot will fail.

              body: >
                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.

                The bbappend uses a local `resin-files` directory for additional
                file

                entries but some of these files ended up in `files`. This works
                well if

                the recipe used is the one in the same directory as the `files`

                subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the
                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                bbappended files.

                The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping

                this naming to be consistent across the file.


                The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service
                dependency:

                resin-partition-mounter[440]: ERROR: Timeout while waiting

                for filesystem label to appear


                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

        It's been observed on EFI machines that at the first boot after
        provisioning there is some bootstrap code in the first sector of
        the boot media (even though during provisioning we make sure we
        remove this bootstrap code). In such a case (only on some machines),
        the next time we reboot the machine, it will not recognize the media
        as a valid EFI boot media and the boot will fail.

      hash: 987879925498f26396334650e7f9e7216d171a4c
      body: |
        At this point we need to figure out more scenarios that would trigger
        a reboot before healthcheck actually runs (such as supervisor triggered
        reboots).
        Such an early reboot is not an indication of a hostOS update failure and
        so we do not wish for rollbacks to take place in these scenarios.

        Until all corner cases are discussed and handled in the OS, we disable
        rollback functionality.

        boot resinOS. After a HUP, there will be a redundant vmlinuz file

        This hooks tests for its presence and removes the redundant file.

        Any changes to the grub.cfg file are not updated in the legacy
        grub. Add the grub.cfg file in the bootfiles so that grub.cfg
        is updated during a HUP.

        The HUP hook needs to be updated to remove the redundant grub.cfg
        file.

    - subject: Add Automated Rollback support to grub.cfg
      hash: 93336dfa2ff53714eb15550f7a74c13f8724a973
      body: |
        Automated Rollback support in meta-resin is used to recover the device
        in case a HUP fails. The rollback services rely on resin_root_part
        and upgrade_available variables to be present in the grub.cfg file.

        Their usage is similar to the u-boot use of these variables.

        Bootcount is incremented in grubenv before loading the kernel.
        If a boot fails, grub will try to load the kernel from the previous
        rootfs.

        If boot succeeds, the rollback systemd services will check and
        update upgrade_available and resin_root_part in the grub.cfg file

        The strange logic to store bootcount is due to limited scripting
        options in grub environment.

                This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from
                config.json

                to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as
                the

                destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in
                between keys

                brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the
                balena backend

                through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool
                (os-config). The final

                `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in
                the dropbear

                service.


                These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be
                provided

                as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

                {
                  [...]
                  "os": {
                    "sshKeys": [
                      "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
                      "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
                    ]
                  },

                This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
                DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

                The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
                v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
                if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

                Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
                fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
                an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

                This patch bumps the balena version in meta-resin.


                The update in balena adds support to pass an argument to mobynit
                which

                allows mobynit to mount a rootfs from a custom path.


                The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount
                the

                rootfs partition from /mnt/sysroot/inactive and return the
                destination

                path in stdout.

              hash: 3df6e1906e1138a8cd10d15ac3008685b90f75f8
              body: >
                Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was
                running

                over the host's network stack which means that all the packets
                were

                treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication
                was

                redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.

                In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of
                bridge

                network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In
                this case,

                the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the
                redirection to

                redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.

                This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets
                to

                redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks
                too.


                As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to
                redsocks.

                This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if
                the

                redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

                We would like resin-altboot service to run before balena starts

                resin-altboot checks if the boot configuration is set to run

                resinOS from rootA(B) but we are actually running rootB(A) due
                to

                something.


                If rollback-altboot triggers, it will run hooks to refresh boot
                files

                and reboot. There is no point starting balena in such a device
                state

                as that will only slow down the hooks from running.

                This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle

                automated OS rollback functionality.


                The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot
                mode

                i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But
                we are

                actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen
                if

                a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in
                resinOS_uEnv

                txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.


                The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change
                the

                bootfiles.


                The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if
                vpn is

                online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

              body: >
                This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.


                If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the

                partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env

                variables.


                To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following
                in

                their u-boot


                Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending
                on the

                device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether
                that

                is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.


                If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the
                boot

                partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"


                E.g. for rpi3

                CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_DEVPART=0:1

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_NAME="bootcount.env"

                Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra

                grub.cfg

                files.


                Check for the presense of those variables and update them if
                they

                exist.


                Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg


                For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the
                pattern

                that exists in u-boot.

                i.e.
                 Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
                 Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
                 upgrade_available is set
                 Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
                 reaches 2.

                u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to
                reduce

                writes to sd card.


                If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the
                bootcount

                variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that
                u-boot

                starts counting.


                It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set

                upgrade_available=0


                For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot
                partition

                in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.

        This file allows other components to uniquely parse the information that
        is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by
        versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to
        provide nested-changelogs.
